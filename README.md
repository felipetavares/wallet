Life-planning app for terminal

The basic functionality of this app is based upon 'hooks' for example, we have the basic hook

_deposit.single_

wich when added will make a single deposit in a given date. Another example would be:

_deposit.monthly_

wich makes an deposit of a given amount every month.

The basic hooks are all in two categories:

_draw.xxx_
_deposit.xxx_
